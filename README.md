# Rewire

An iOS app to help your brain recover from doom scrolling and digital overstimulation.

Years of endless feeds, short-form content, and constant notifications have trained our brains to expect constant novelty. Rewire helps you break free and restore your ability to focus deeply, be present, and feel at peace with stillness.

## What it does

- **Streak Tracking**: Track your days free from mindless scrolling with a live counter
- **Emergency SOS**: When urges hit, use guided breathing exercises, read motivation cards, or pick an activity to redirect your attention
- **Daily Journal**: Check in with yourself - track energy, confidence, focus, and mood over time
- **Milestones**: Unlock achievements as your brain heals, each with real neuroscience about what's happening in your head
- **Stats**: See your progress with charts showing mood trends, streak history, and consistency

## The Science

Neuroplasticity is real. Your brain adapted to constant stimulation, and it can adapt back. The first weeks are hard - dopamine receptors need time to heal. By day 14, most people report improved focus. By 90 days, significant neural rewiring has occurred.

## Tech

- SwiftUI (iOS 17+)
- SwiftData for local persistence
- Swift Charts for stats
- MVVM architecture

All data stays on your device. No accounts, no cloud, no tracking.

## Build

Open `Reborn.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run on a simulator or device.
