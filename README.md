POV: You can't watch a 10-minute video without checking your phone. You feel anxious when there's nothing to scroll. You used to read books. Now you can't focus for 5 minutes.

**It's not your fault.** TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts — they literally rewired your dopamine system. Your brain got addicted to the constant hits of novelty.

But here's the thing nobody talks about: **your brain can heal.**

## What happens when you stop scrolling

<div align="center">

| Day | What's happening in your brain |
|:---:|-------------------------------|
| **1-7** | Withdrawal. Your brain is SCREAMING for dopamine. This is the hard part. |
| **14** | Dopamine receptors start recovering. Focus improves. |
| **30** | You can sit with your thoughts again. Boredom feels peaceful, not painful. |
| **90** | Significant neural rewiring. You're literally a different person. |

</div>

This isn't motivation. **This is neuroscience.**

## The truth nobody wants to hear

The first 2 weeks are going to suck. Your brain will try to convince you to quit. That's the addiction talking.

But if you push through? You get your life back.

> **Your attention is the most valuable thing you own. Stop giving it away for free.**
